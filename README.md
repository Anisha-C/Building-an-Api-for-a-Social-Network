# Building-an-Api-for-a-Social-Network

## Purpose
In this application, I got the opportunity to create the back end for a social network like instagram for example. Using insomnia I was able to test the routes I created.
User is able to create a thought, retrieve all thoughts and a single thought, delete a thought and create/delete a reaction for the thought. User is also able to 
create users, get all users and a single user, also able to create friends and delete friends. This was a very interesting application and has given me ideas for future
social networks that I can create.
